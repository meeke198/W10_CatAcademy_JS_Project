# W10_NinjaCat_JS_Project
Background

It is a cat version of Typer Shark Delux. Players will help the ninjacat learn English
 by typing out the words appear on the whiteboard. Time set will be 30s each round. 
There is a scoreboard to update how many words players teache the cat.
Cat gets excited when players type proper words. If players cant teach her all the 
words on whiteboard in 30s, she gets bored and falls asleep. Game is over :))

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

The Canvas API to render the game board
Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
npm to manage project dependencies

Implementation Timeline

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Create classes. Making the ninjacat animation. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. 

Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic of NinjaCat's Game of Life. Ensure that I can advance a generation of random words on the board appropriately.

Tuesday: Manage input words type out by player. Make sure the score recoding work appropriately. Then, focus on user controls: start, stop, reset, and clicking on boardgame.

Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

Bonus features
